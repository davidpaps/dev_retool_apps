        #### How it works


        This app pulls data from the internal Postgres Database backing this
        Retool instance. Specifically, it queries the `audit_trail_events`,
        `page_saves`, and `users` tables. 


        This app also comes predefined with SQL queries, which you can duplicate
        and modify to surface whichever adoption metrics you desire. 


        #### Notes


        ###### Avoid large queries! 


        If this app is running on a high-usage Retool instance, be sure to avoid
        running large queries. 


        ###### Truncating your tables to improve performance


        You can truncate these tables by running queries against it. We
        recommend copying the contents to another (external) DB before doing so
        to preserve all logs.
